  Why Compress

-----

## What’s Dynamics

----

  Dynamics, in the contexts of Music, is the Difference between Load and Soft Parts of Music.

----

  For Audio Engineer, We Not Only Looking for over All Music, But Also for individual Part of Peaks and Dips

----

  We Called the Difference between Loudest and Softest Part of an Audio Source is Dynamic Range.

-----

## Why We Need a Compressor

-----

Compressor is a Processor that Allows Us to Manipulate the Dynamic Range of an Audio Signal.

----

First Stage: Control the Dynamic Range, It Allows Us to Level Out the Volume, so that the Soft Parts Become More Intelligible, and Loud Parts don’t Stick Out.

----

Use as a Transient Designer.

----

Add some Color Tone.

-----

## Threshold

-----
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate-->
Threshold is the Control that Tells the Compressor WHEN to Start Compressing the incoming Signal.

----
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate-->
It Set in Decibels (dB)

----
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate-->
When the Signal Gets Louder than the Threshold, the Compressor will Start Working.

-----

## Ratio

----

Ratio Control Tells the Compressor HOW MUCH Compression to Apply to the Signal.

-----

## Gain Reduction Meter

----

We Can Actually SEE How Much Compression We Are Applying to the Signal.

----

Gain Reduction Meter (Or GR Meter) Tells Us How the Compression are Effecting to The Signal.

----

It is the Number of Decibels the Signal is Losing as a Result of the Compression that is Applied

-----

## Why We Need a GR Meter

----

Helps Us Setting Threshold

----

Helps Us Seeing that Compression is being Applied

-----

## Attack

----

The Attack is a Control that Sets the Speed at Which the Compressor Reacts to the Signal After it Crosses the Threshold.

----

It Usually Measured in Milliseconds (MS), And Can Be Measured in Microseconds (μs)

-----

## Some Misunderstanding

----

Compressor Begins Working IMMEDIATELY After Signal Crosses the Threshold.

----

The Attack Time for the Setting is the Time It Takes for the Compressor to Reach 2/3rds of the Target Gain Reduction.

----

Attack is a SPEED parameter, not a TIME parameter.

-----

## Why We Want to Change the Attack Control?

----

Basically, Attack Control = Transient Control.

----

More Transients  = Slower Attack

----

Less Transients = Faster Attack

-----

Release

----

Release is the Control that Sets the Speed at Which the Compressor Stops Compressing the Signal After it has Fallen Back Below the Threshold.

----

It Can Measured in 1ms, But Also Can be 4sec. Or More in Some Cases.

-----

## Some Misunderstanding Again

----

Similar to Attack Settings, the Rate that Compressor Stops Compressing the Signal Also Can Be Controlled.

----

The Time that Setting to is the Time it Takes for the Compressor to Recover 2/3rds of the Gain that was Reduced.

----

Also, Release is a SPEED parameter, NOT a TIME parameter.

-----

## How To Set Release Time Musically

----

If Release is Too Fast, The Sound Could Sound Pupping.

----

If Release is Too Slow, The Compressor Will Not Stop Working even Next Transient Comes in.

----

You Can Focus on Tempo and Speed of the Song.

( Looks the GR Meter ! )

-----

## Make-Up Gain

----

Make-Up Gain (Sometimes is Output Knob), Is Used to Turn Up the Signal to Compensate for Any Gain that was Lost Due to the Compression.

----

Gain Reduction Mains the Compressor Turns Down Those Many Volumes. It Will Cause Gain Staging Issues.

----

Gain Staging is Turns to Refers to Setting the Optimal Gain Level For Each Step Along the Way in an Audio Signal Path.

----

It Also Helps A/B Testing.

-----

## Compressor Placement

----

If You Have Some Fixing EQ, The Compressor Should Become After the EQ.

----

If You Want to Enhance the Sound, The Compressor Should Become Before the EQ.

----

If You Want Some Other Effects, The Ear is Your Only Ultimate Tool.

-----

Lab: Compression In Action

-----

## Homework

----

- Try a Compressor, Compress Some Audio Signal, and Listening to.
- Do Some Ear Training Staff For Compressor (Especially For Attack & Release Time)
