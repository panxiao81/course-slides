## Multi-Band Compressor 

----

A multiband compressor splits the frequency spectrum into separate bands. Each frequency band also has dedicated compression settings.

----

You can use Multi-Band Compressor when you want more control to the sound.

----

### A Demo

-----

## De-esser

----

The easiest way to understand the de-esser is that it is just a single band multi-band compressor.

So, de-esser is not just for esses.

----

There are some modes which de-essers are working.

----

- wide-band
- Split

----

For wide-band de=esser, you can just use any compressor that supports side-chaining.

And for split, just use a simple multi-band compressor.

Let me demonstrate for you.

----

De-esser is good, but **DON'T OVER DO IT!**

You still need some esses, **DON'T CLEAN THEM ALL**

If the esses are too loud, just turn down the volume by using automation.

-----

## Compression technics

----

Don't let a compressor works too hard.

If it does not get the target GRs, You can use serial compression.

Serial compression is just use multible compressor, and serial connect it.

-----

Many Times we are using downward compression.

Parallel compression is a way to do upward compression.

it's not for turn the loud part down, but turn slient part up.

In DAW, we usually create a Aux track, Insert a compressor, and send the origin signal to this Aux track.

----

A demostration.

## That's All, Thank you.
